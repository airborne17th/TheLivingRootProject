                    <p>
                        This is a digital adaptation of the The Law of Root, the rules reference for Root: A Woodland
                        Game of Might and Right. <br>
                        This version is up-to-date with the Fourth Printing edition.

                    <h2>1. Golden Rules</h2>
                    <h3>1.1 Rules Conflicts</h3>
                    <p>1.1.1
                        <strong>Precedence.</strong>
                        If a card conflicts with the Law, follow the card. If the Learning to Play guide
                        conflicts with the Law, follow the Law. If you follow both a general rule and a faction rule,
                        follow
                        both; if you cannot, follow the faction rule. <br><br>
                        1.1.2 <strong>Use of Cannot.</strong> The term cannot is absolute. It cannot be overridden
                        unless explicitly
                        instructed. <br><br>
                        1.1.3 <strong>Simultaneous Effects.</strong> If two game effects occur simultaneously, the
                        player taking the
                        current
                        turn
                        chooses their order, unless otherwise noted. <br><br>
                        1.1.4 <strong>Use of Treat.</strong> If you are prompted to treat one thing as another, the
                        former takes on all
                        the
                        properties of the latter. (For example, if you caused Outrage while treating yourself as another
                        player, the other player would give the card.)
                    </p>
                    <h3>1.2 Public and Private Information</h3>
                    <p>
                        1.2.1
                        <strong>Hands.</strong> Players may only reveal cards in their hand if explicitly instructed,
                        but the number of cards
                        in their hand is public information. <br><br>
                        1.2.2
                        <strong>Discard.</strong> The discard pile can be searched at any time.
                    </p>
                    <h3>1.3 Negotiation and Deals</h3>
                    <p>
                        1.3.1
                        <strong>Agreements.</strong> Players may discuss the game during play and make agreements, but
                        they
                        are non-binding. <br><br>
                        1.3.2
                        <strong>Cards.</strong> Players may only give cards to each other if explicitly instructed.
                    </p>
                    <h3>1.4 Players and Factions</h3>
                    <p>
                        For simplicity, the Law refers to players, not factions. However, game effects (such as
                        abilities
                        and persistent effects) are properties of factions, not players. While controlling pieces of a
                        faction they do not own, a player follows the rules of that faction unless explicitly
                        instructed.
                    </p>
                    <h3>1.5 Game Structure</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each player's turn consists of three phases: Birdsong, Daylight, and Evening. After a player
                        completes all three phases, the next clockwise player begins their turn. Play continues until
                        one
                        player has won the game (3.1).
                    </p>
                    <h2>2. Key Terms and Concepts</h2>
                    <h3>2.1 Cards</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each card has a suit: bird, fox, rabbit, or mouse. Most cards also have an effect you can craft
                        (4.1).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.1.1
                        <strong>Birds Are Wild.</strong> You can always treat a bird card as a card of another suit,
                        even if you must
                        spend,
                        take, or give multiple cards of the same suit. <br><br>
                        2.1.1a <strong>Forced Effects.</strong> If you are prompted to discard or give a fox, rabbit, or
                        mouse
                        card, you must
                        treat
                        your bird cards as the prompted suit. <br><br>
                        2.1.1b <strong>Reverse Substitution.</strong> If you are prompted to spend, discard, take, or
                        give a
                        bird card, you
                        cannot
                        substitute a card of another suit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.1.2
                        <strong>Drawing Cards.</strong> Whenever you are prompted to draw a card, take it from the
                        shared deck. If the
                        deck is
                        ever empty, shuffle the discard pile immediately to form a new deck. <br><br>
                        2.1.3
                        <strong>Spending and Discarding Cards.</strong> Whenever you are prompted to discard or spend a
                        card, place it in
                        the
                        shared discard pile unless it is a dominance card (3.3). <br><br>
                        2.1.4
                        <strong>Revealing Cards.</strong> Whenever you are prompted to reveal a card, place it in your
                        play area (2.6).
                        2.1.5
                        <strong>Ambush Cards.</strong> There are five ambush cards: one mouse, one rabbit, one fox, and
                        two birds. You
                        may
                        spend an ambush card for its suit, but it does not have a crafted effect. You may also play one
                        in
                        battle to deal hits (4.3.1). <br><br>
                        2.1.6
                        <strong>Dominance Cards.</strong> There are four dominance cards matching the four suits. You
                        may spend a
                        dominance
                        card for its suit, but it cannot be crafted. You may also play one to permanently change your
                        victory condition (3.3). <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.2 <strong>Clearings and Paths</strong>
                        The map of the Woodland is composed of many clearings linked by paths. <br><br>
                        2.2.1
                        <strong>Adjacency.</strong> A clearing is adjacent to all other clearings linked to it by a
                        path. <br><br>
                        2.2.2
                        <strong>Suit.</strong> Every clearing has a suit of mouse, rabbit, or fox. <br><br>
                        2.2.3
                        <strong>Slots.</strong> Each clearing has a number of slots, shown as white boxes. Whenever you
                        place a building,
                        it
                        fills an open slot. You cannot place a building in a clearing with no open slots. <br><br>
                        2.2.4
                        <strong>Ruins.</strong> Slots marked with a small "R" begin the game filled with ruins. Ruins
                        can only be removed
                        by
                        the Vagabond's Explore action (9.5.3).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.3 <strong>Rivers.</strong>
                        Many clearings are linked by rivers. By default rivers are not paths, but can be treated as
                        paths if
                        explicitly instructed. Rivers do not divide clearings or forests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.4 <strong>Forests</strong>
                        Areas on the map enclosed by paths and clearings are called forests. <br><br>
                        2.4.1
                        <strong>Adjacency.</strong> A forest is adjacent to all clearings that touch it without crossing
                        a path, and it is
                        adjacent to all forests that are separated by only one path.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.5 <strong>Pieces</strong>

                        Each faction has a set of pieces listed on the back of its faction board. Pieces are limited by
                        the
                        contents of the game. If you are prompted to place, take, or remove a piece but you cannot, you
                        must
                        place, take, or remove the maximum number possible.
                        2.5.1
                        Warriors. If you are prompted to place a warrior, take it from your supply. If one of your
                        warriors
                        is removed, return it to your supply. (The Vagabond pawn is not a warrior and cannot be
                        removed.)
                        2.5.2
                        Buildings. If you are prompted to place a building, take the leftmost building from its track on
                        your
                        faction board. If one of your buildings is removed, return it to the rightmost empty space of
                        its
                        track.
                        2.5.3
                        Tokens. If you are prompted to place a token, take the leftmost token from its track, if any, or
                        take
                        it from your supply. If one of your tokens is removed, return it to the rightmost empty space of
                        its
                        track, if any, or to your supply.
                        2.5.4
                        Items.If you are prompted to take an item, take it from the shared supply on the map and place
                        it in
                        the Crafted Items box on your faction board. If you are prompted to remove an item, remove it
                        from
                        the game permanently.
                        2.5.5
                        Other.If you are prompted to use any other piece (pawn, marker, etc.), follow its explicit
                        instructions.
                    </p>
                    2.6Play Area
                    Your play area is the area around your faction board. Cards in your play area can only be spent,
                    discarded, or used for other purposes if explicitly instructed.
                    2.7Enemy
                    An enemy is any other faction not in a coalition with you (9.2.8).
                    2.8Ruler
                    The ruler of a clearing is the player with the most total warriors and buildings in that clearing.
                    (Tokens and pawns do not contribute to rule.) If there is a tie between players in a clearing, no
                    one there is the ruler.
                    3.Victory
                    3.1How to Win
                    The first player to reach 30 victory points immediately wins the game. If multiple players reach 30
                    or more victory points simultaneously, the player taking the current turn wins.
                    3.2Scoring Victory Points
                    Each faction has a unique way to score victory points, but any faction can score victory points as
                    follows.
                    3.2.1
                    Removing Buildings and Tokens.Whenever you remove an enemy's building or token, you score one
                    victory point.
                    3.2.2
                    Crafting Items.Whenever you craft an item (4.1), you score the victory points listed on the card.
                    3.3Dominance Cards
                    The deck holds four dominance cards, which let you win the game without scoring 30 victory points.
                    3.3.1
                    Activating.During your Daylight, if you have at least 10 victory points, you may activate a
                    dominance card by placing it in your play area. Remove your score marker from the score track. You
                    can no longer score victory points.
                    Mouse, Rabbit, or Fox Dominance.You win the game immediately if you rule three clearings of the suit
                    matching the activated dominance card at the start of your Birdsong.
                    Bird Dominance.You win the game immediately if you rule two clearings in opposite corners at the
                    start of your Birdsong.
                    3.3.2
                    Activated Cards.An activated dominance card does not count against your hand limit, and it cannot be
                    removed from play. You cannot replace an activated dominance card with a different one.
                    3.3.3
                    Spending for Suit.A dominance card can be spent for its suit. However, when it would be placed in
                    the discard pile, instead place it near the map to show it is available to be taken.
                    3.3.4
                    Taking Available Cards.During your Daylight, you can take an available dominance card into your hand
                    by spending a card of matching suit.
                    4.Key Actions
                    4.1Craft
                    You can craft most cards from your hand to gain an immediate or persistent effect.
                    4.1.1
                    Cost.To craft a card, you must activate crafting pieces of the suits listed in the card's
                    bottom-left corner. The suit of a crafting piece matches its clearing. Each crafting piece may be
                    activated only once per turn. A three-color question mark denotes a crafting piece of any suit.
                    4.1.2
                    Immediate Effects.When you craft an immediate effect, resolve its effect and then discard the card.
                    If it shows an item, take the matching item from the supply and place it in the Crafted Items box on
                    your faction board. If the card lists an item not in the supply, the card cannot be crafted.
                    4.1.3
                    Persistent Effects.When you craft a persistent effect, place it in your play area. You may use the
                    effect as described on the card.
                    4.1.4
                    No Duplicates.You cannot craft a persistent effect if you have an identical persistent effect in
                    your play area.
                    4.2Move
                    When you move, you may take any number (more than zero) of your warriors or your pawn from one
                    clearing and move them to one adjacent clearing.
                    4.2.1
                    You Must Rule.To take a move, you must rule the origin clearing, destination clearing, or both.
                    4.2.2
                    No Movement Limits.A given piece can be moved any number of times per turn. If you are prompted to
                    take multiple moves, you may move the same or separate groups of warriors.
                    4.3Battle
                    When you battle, choose a clearing where you have warriors or your pawn as the clearing of battle.
                    You are the attacker. Choose another player in the clearing of battle to be the defender.
                    4.3.1
                    Step 1: Defender May Ambush.The defender may play one ambush card matching the clearing of battle.
                    If the ambush is not foiled, the defender deals two hits immediately. Then, the defender discards
                    the ambush card. If no attacking warriors remain, end the battle immediately.
                    Foil Ambush.After the defender plays an ambush card, the attacker may cancel its effect by also
                    playing an ambush card matching the clearing of the battle. (The defender still discards their
                    ambush card.)
                    4.3.2
                    Step 2: Roll Dice and Add Extra Hits.Roll both dice. The attacker will deal hits equal to the higher
                    roll, and the defender will deal hits equal to the lower roll. If the rolls are equal, attacker and
                    defender will deal the same number of hits. (The use of "will" here reflects that hits are not dealt
                    until step 3.)
                    Maximum Rolled Hits.The maximum hits you can deal from rolling equals the number of your warriors in
                    the clearing of battle, whether you are the attacker or defender.
                    Extra Hits.After counting hits from rolling, the attacker and defender can add extra hits by using
                    special abilities or other effects in their play areas. (Extra hits are not limited by the number of
                    warriors in the clearing of battle.)
                    Defenseless.If the defender has no warriors in the clearing of battle, the attacker will deal an
                    extra hit.
                    4.3.3
                    Step 3: Deal Hits.Attacker and defender deal hits simultaneously. Each hit you deal removes one
                    piece. The player taking hits chooses which of their pieces are removed from the clearing of battle,
                    but must choose to remove all their warriors there before they choose to remove any of their
                    buildings or tokens there in any order. (You score one victory point per enemy building or token
                    removed.)
                    5.Setup
                    5.1Standard Setup Procedure
                    5.1.1
                    Step 1: Assign Factions and Starting Player.Assign one faction to each player using any method. The
                    viable factions at each player count are listed in the learning-to-play guide (page 22). Determine
                    the starting player and seating order randomly. Each player takes their chosen faction board and all
                    pieces, as listed on the back of the faction board.
                    5.1.2
                    Step 2: Place Score Markers.Each player places their score marker on "0" on the score track.
                    5.1.3
                    Step 3: Draw Starting Hands.If you are playing with two players, remove all four dominance cards
                    from the deck. Shuffle the deck. Each player draws three cards.
                    5.1.4
                    Step 4: Place Ruins.Place a ruin in each slot on the map marked with an "R" (four in total).
                    5.1.5
                    Step 5: Form Item Supply.Place these items on the matching spaces of the item supply near the top of
                    the map: 2 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 .
                    5.1.6
                    Step 6: Gather Other Pieces.Hand out the 16 faction overview cards as desired, and place the two
                    custom dice near the map.
                    5.1.7
                    Step 7: Set Up Factions.In setup order (A, B, C, etc.), each player follows their faction's setup
                    instructions, listed in their rules section and on the back of their faction board.
